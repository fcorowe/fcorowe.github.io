      <title>Sensing global patterns and trajectories of socio-economic inequality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to quantify and analyse the evolution of spatial inequality across the globe using machine learning and satellite imagery. Preliminary findings reveal marked patterns of inequality. Intense presence of rich urban agglomerations in developed regions with large land consumption, intense public illumination, and high population density, particularly prominent across the US and Europe. Deprived areas with dense urban centres and limited illumination, or densely inhabited rural areas with presence of electrification prevail in rural parts of India. Poor regions with diffuse but high dense settlement infrastructure and scarce illumination are predominant across parts of rural China.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using satellite imagery to measure the evolution of cities</title>
      <link>https://franciscorowe.github.io/project/satellite_cities/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sustainable urban habitats are a key component of global challenges, and efficient management and planning of cities are pivotal to all 17 UN SDGs. Over 90% of projected urban growth by 2050 will occur in less developed countries. Prior work on urbanisation has identified the benefits of agglomeration and improvements in health and education, which tend to outweigh the costs of congestion, pollution and poverty. Yet research has focused on Western cities: urban areas with high-income, in developed countries. Much less is known about urban habitats in less developed countries. This project aims to improve our understanding of urban areas levearing on large scale satellite imagery and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
