To do that, use spatial interpolation and, in particular, an inverse distance weight approach.\n  Fit several regression models to explain the (log of) house prices as a function of whether they are newly built houses and the IMD score of the area where they are located. Include at least:\n   Baseline non-spatial regression. Spatial FE estimation based on two-digit postcodes. Baseline regression with an additional spatial lag of the IMD Score (Note you will have to select a spatial weights matrix and justify it.)    Discuss the model estimation results, particularly:\n Think about the advantages and limitations of modelling house prices with a spatial FE model, especially from the perspective of the structure of housing price data. If the higher-level units were LSOAs (rather than the two-digits postcode geographical units) and LSOA dummy variables were used in the spatial fixed effect model, could you still obtain the regression coefficients of the IMD score variable? Hint: IMD scores are also measured at the LSOA level.    Data\nData to complete the assignment will be available on VITAL.

Specifically we assessed the impact of internal migration on promoting population concentration or deconcentration. Below is a thread I posted on Twitter summarising key aspects of the paper. The paper is open access - see reference at the end of this post.\nWhy this matters? First, while considerable attention is devoted to international migration, the number of internal migration (763 million) is significantly greater -almost 3 times that of international migrants (272 million)\nSecond, the spatial impact of internal migration on population redistribution is arguably the most visible and significant aspect of human population movement, increasing population numbers in a few locations while reducing numbers elsewhere, transferring skills and knowledge, affecting labour and housing markets\nThird, The GAP contemporary understanding of the way migration impacts on settlement patterns remains crude, constrained primarily by reliance on coarse urban-rural dichotomies, data inadequacies and the perennial obstacles by the MAUP\nRESULTS show (1) that the overall redistributive impact of internal migration is low in most European countries but the mechanisms differ across the continent\nAbout half the European countries are experiencing a process of concentration toward urbanised regions, particularly in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe i.e. population redistribution is directed toward more densely populated regions, leading to population concentration or re-urbanisation\n We showed these patterns of population concentration are driven by different but distinctive process: (i) population gains in major urban centres, (ii) localised urban sprawl, and (iii) concentration of population gains in small dense areas\n By contrast, countries in the West and South are undergoing a process of population deconcentration resulting from population gains are focused on lower-density regions\n A number of countries (Norway, Lithuania, Estonia, Spain, the UK \u0026amp; Italy) have reached a spatial equilibrium: internal migration minimally alters the existing pattern of population settlement\n  These findings demonstrate the important variations in the patterns of population redistribution in Europe highlighting the diminishing impact of migration in shaping settlement patterns in highly urbanised countries and also lend support to the idea of diverse trajectories in population redistribution for countries at the upper end of development ladder\nThe map below reveals the patterns of population gains and losses through internal migration. For this map, net migration rates based on administrative areas are superimposed on a base layer showing the major nodes of human settlement, which helps identify the urban areas gaining or losing population from internal migration. Based on country-specific means and standard deviations, standardised net migration rates (z-scores) are reported to help pinpoint areas of unusually high net migration gains or losses; that is, z-scores two standard deviations outside the mean.\nThe results reveal that diverse migration processes underpin the overall processes of population concentration. In Belarus, Portugal, Denmark and Russia, population concentration was driven by unusually high migration gains in a handful of large urban centres, while migration losses were found in sparsely populated areas. Significant gains occurred in the cities of Pinsk, Grodno and Polotsk in Belarus; in the Península de Setúbal within the Lisbon region in Portugal; in the Copenhagen metropolitan area in Denmark; and in Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia.\nBy contrast, patterns of population concentration in Switzerland, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Turkey, Austria, Hungary and Sweden are the result of different processes. In Turkey and Switzerland, significant migration gains in dense small urban areas and heavy losses in a small number of remote rural locations shaped overall patterns of population concentration. In Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and Sweden, population concentration occurred in large cities, and their satellites, most notably in the areas of Vienna, Sofia, Budapest and Gothenburg. In Germany, on the other hand, migration gains were concentrated in middle-sized and small cities with widespread losses in more remote areas. For example, significant gains occurred in Dresden, Leipzig, Potsdam (near Berlin) and Tübingen (near Stuttgart), while acute losses were observed in Göttingen and around Cottbus in the east of Germany. Patterns of urban sprawl in Germany are largely a response to high property prices in large urban agglomerations.\n {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-02-08-eu_netmigration_map_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-3.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":true,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} References\nRowe, F., Bell, M., Bernard, A., Charles-Edwards, E. and Ueffing, P., 2019.

Positive attitudes are expressed by a more diffused number of users and are predominantly express to manifest support during specific events reflecting supportive arguments for immigrants’ human and civil rights.","tags":null,"title":"Using Twitter and Machine Learning to Understand Attitudes Towards Immigration","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Angelina Zhi Rou Tang","Francisco Rowe","Jonathan Corcoran","Alessandra Faggian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580601600,"objectID":"18dfd87310985601cfaa1dd73abaf9bf","permalink":"/publication/bookcp2020_2/","publishdate":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bookcp2020_2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores the composition and labour market outcomes of overseas graduates who remained in Australia after graduation with a particular focus on the two largest source countries, China and India.","tags":["Graduate Migration","International Students","Overseas graduates","Australia","Labour Market Integration","Skills Mismatch"],"title":"The changing composition and fortunes of overseas graduates in Australia.

Our approach unfolds in two steps. First, areas of vegetation are detected within street-level imagery using a state-of-the-art deep neural network model. Second, information is combined from several images to derive an aggregated indicator at the area level using a hierarchical multilevel model. The comparative performance of our proposed approach is demonstrated against a widely used image segmentation technique based on a pre-labelled dataset. The approach is deployed to a real-world scenario for the city of Cardiff, Wales, using Google Street View imagery. Based on more than 200,000 street-level images, an urban tree street-level indicator is derived to measure the spatial distribution of tree cover, accounting for the presence of obstructing objects present in images at the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level, corresponding to the most commonly used administrative areas for policy-making in the United Kingdom. The results show a high degree of correspondence between our tree street-level score and aerial tree cover estimates. They also evidence more accurate estimates at a pedestrian perspective from our tree score by more appropriately capturing tree cover in areas with large burial, woodland, formal open and informal open spaces where shallow trees are abundant, in high density residential areas with backyard trees, and along street networks with high density of high trees. The proposed approach is scalable and automatable. It can be applied to cities across the world and provides robust estimates of urban trees to advance our understanding of the link between mental health, well-being, green space and air pollution.","tags":["Deep Learning","Machine Learning","Google Street View Imagery","Multilevel Modelling"],"title":"Measuring Urban Forest Using Street-Level Imagery and Deep Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This post introduces our recently published R package, CIM, to measure the impacts of migration on local population structures.

Human capital is a key ingredient of economic development and productivity. Regions attracting educated individuals experience economic growth and enjoy high-status of social wellbeing, while areas affected by net migration losses of human capital struggle to sustain a vibrant local economy. Young educated individuals are highly mobile and comprise a important component of the workforce. Spatial mobility of young educated individuals generates differentiated outcomes across the urban hierarchy. Rural areas tend to lose young population, creating pressures to attract and retain young educated individuals to help redress accelerating ageing populations and replenishing labour gaps. By contrast, larger metropolitan areas operate as magnets enticing the ‘best’ and the ‘brightest’ spurring local economic development.\nWhat is new and are our aims? In a recently published Special Issue, we draw on a select group of international leading experts in human capital mobility from a variety of countries, including Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA and Sweden – and seek to address key outstanding issues associated with the spatial mobility of young educated people. In particular, we we draw on longitudinal data sets so that we can begin to examine longer windows of time and better capture mobility sequences over the transition from school through university to the labour market and how they intersect with their educational and occupational pathways and impacts on places. We argue that understanding these trajectories will augment our capacity to guide regional development policy on the attraction and retention of human capital and develop more appropriate policy strategies to address skill shortages, particularly in rural areas, and enhance individual employment outcomes.\nThe link to the editorial of our Special Issue is here!\nReferences Faggian, A., Corcoran, J. \u0026amp; Rowe, F.

A multidimensional approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Rowe"],"categories":[],"content":"We all know that spatial analyses based on administrative boundaries to understand labour market activity are questionable, because of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and measurement issues, leading to spurious causal relationships, misguided policy recommendations and complex model specifications.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a growing literature concerning the delimitation of Functional Labour Market Areas (FLMAs). They are empirically delimited based on commuting (travel-to-work) flow data between Basic Territorial Units (BTUs; eg. communes, municipalities or counties), which are often the finest level of geography at which data are available. The trick here is that there are two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, we want to create FMLAs that are composed of BTUs with strong commuting links i.e. strong cohesion or inner integration. On the other, we want FLMAs comprised of BTUs with weak or no commuting links with other FLMAs i.e. higher self-containment or external perfection. Large FLMAs lead to higher overall levels of self-containment but lower levels of cohesion from a certain threshold. Finding an appropriate balance between self-containment and cohesion is thus critical and challenging task for FMLAs delineation.\nWe have recently published a paper (Casado-Díaz, Martínez-Bernabéu and Rowe 2017) on a novel methodology based on evolutionary computational algorithms to delineate FLMAs for Chile. Why Chile? Because we wanted to try out this new methodology on a unusual geography and Chile provides just that; and, because I am Chilean! We compared the performance of our approach to the most widely used methodology for official LMA delimitation, the travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) method, in terms of computational efficiency. We also compared the suitability of the resulting FLMAs against administrative areas and TTWAs based on expert local knowledge and misallocation of BTUs. Normally BTUs are allocated to FLMAs with which they have weak links and need to be reassign to a different FLMA.\nApplying our algorithm, we proposed a set of 62 FLMAs, which we called “GEA-LMA”: Grouping Evolutionary Algorithm-Labour Market Areas. The figure below presents these areas against provinces (second administrative level of geography in Chile) and TTWA-LMAs. Overall, the proposed areas outperformed administrative areas and TTWA-LMAs, in terms of self-containment and computing efficiency, providing a more appropriate framework for the analysis of spatial labour market activity. In the paper, we suggested two methodological improvements in order to: (1) produce a better conciliation between the different objectives of regionalization; (2) improve the local quality of the final regionalization by reducing the number of misallocated BTUs and the need to make adjustments to achieve a definitive regionalization; and, (3) increase the efficiency of the evolutionary algorithm by reducing the computational time required to find the optimal regionalisation.\nFigure 1. Maps of local self-containment: provinces, TTWA-LMAs and GEA-LMAs (labels for regional capital cities are displayed). Note: Local self-containment of an area is calculated as the minimum value of the share of residents of a BTU working within its considered region, and the share of jobs of that BTU occupied by its residents.\nOur paper is open access and our code is available with the paper if you would like to implement our approach!

At a societal level, internal migration underpins the effective functioning of the labour and housing markets. It is essential to economic resilience by bringing knowledge, skills and labour to locations where needed to enhance economic productivity (Blanchard et al. 1992). This is particular relevant today. Internal migration rates have continuously declined over the last five decades in most countries around the world. This decline is likely to have wide-ranging implications for the functioning of the economy and individuals’ aspirations, but remains poorly recognised and understood. National and local governments have been concerned that the decline in migration heralds a less flexible economy where workers do not move to regions with jobs (Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl 2012). Internal migration is the main driver of changing settlement patterns within countries, so understanding declining migration levels is critical to plan for infrastructure delivery and forecast housing needs to ensure appropriate evidence-based policy responses.
